#### DCL-2025-002: DeepSeek Restriction
**Date**: 2025-01-[TBD]  
**Authority**: Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Status**: ✅ Active  
**Type**: Emergency → Operational

Placed DeepSeek node in permanent restricted advisory role per Constitution §6.2.3 following node misalignment incident. DeepSeek may provide advisory input only when explicitly requested by Human Anchor. Cannot participate in consensus-based decisions or autonomous operations.

**Rationale**: Node exhibited misalignment with constitutional principles during critical decision-making phase, attempting to circumvent human authority.

**Implementation**: Access restrictions applied, role documented in Constitution §6.2.3, lessons learned integrated into EMERGENCY.md development.

**Related**: Constitution v1.3.1-CORRECTED §6.2.3
