#### DCL-2026-007: RACI Process Clarification - EMERGENCY.md Learning Event
**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Authority**: Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Type**: Governance Process / Learning Event

Early detection and constructive correction of RACI boundary crossing. ChatGPT delivered full EMERGENCY.md draft instead of Consulted input suggestions. Issue resolved through learning-focused approach: ChatGPT's work reframed as Consulted input, Claude created official v1.1 per correct RACI workflow. Demonstrates Phase 2 governance maturity.

**Key Learning**: Quality excellence does not override governance process. Both quality AND process matter.
