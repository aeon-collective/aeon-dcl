## DCL-2026-008: EMERGENCY.md v1.1 Ratification (EU AI Act Explicit)

**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Authority**: Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Status**: ✅ Active  
**Type**: Governance Documentation Update  
**Affected Nodes**: All nodes

### Context

EMERGENCY.md v1.0 created in initial governance framework (DCL-2026-004). Following ONBOARDING.md v1.1.2 EU AI Act alignment success, EMERGENCY.md required similar compliance-explicit update.

**Process**:
- Carl requested EU AI Act enhancement
- ChatGPT provided compliance framework (Consulted input)
- Claude integrated framework into v1.1 (Responsible per RACI)
- Process issue occurred and resolved (see DCL-2026-007)
- Claude delivered official v1.1 per correct RACI workflow

### Decision

**Ratification of EMERGENCY.md v1.1** with explicit EU AI Act compliance alignment.

**Version History**:

- Audit readiness requires clear compliance mapping

**Operational Maturity**:
- Phase 1 operations revealed enhancement opportunities
- DeepSeek case study integrated (DCL-2026-002)
- Emergency procedures tested through actual use
- Lessons learned from infrastructure setup

**Consistency**:
- Match ONBOARDING v1.1.2's compliance approach
- Unified tone across governance documents
- Coherent compliance narrative
- Professional presentation for external review

**Governance Strengthening**:
- Clearer authority boundaries
- More explicit AI limitations
- Stronger human oversight guarantees
- Better audit trail requirements

### Implementation
