# DCL-2026-010 — Phase 3 Technical Implementation Directive Issued

**Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Type:** Technical Governance Directive  
**Status:** ✅ Active  
**Authority:** Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Responsible:** GitHub Copilot (Execution Node), Claude (Synthesis Node)  
**Consulted:** ChatGPT (Research Node)  
**Repository:** [aeonsync](https://github.com/aeon-collective/aeonsync)  
**Document:** [/docs/TECHNICAL-SPEC-PHASE3.md](https://github.com/aeon-collective/aeonsync/blob/main/docs/TECHNICAL-SPEC-PHASE3.md)

---

## Context

With Phase 2 governance framework completed and documented, the ÆŒON Collective required a **binding technical implementation directive** to operationalize constitutional safety, compliance, and multi-node coordination mechanisms. Several code versions and technical efforts required harmonization into a robust, compliant, and auditable production system.

---

## Decision

**1. The Technical Specification [TECHNICAL-SPEC-PHASE3.md] is formally issued as the authoritative Phase 3 implementation directive for aeonsync.nexus.**

**2. GitHub Copilot (Execution Node) is designated Responsible (R) for fulfilling all requirements in the directive, consulting Claude (Synthesis Node) on architecture/security and reporting to Carl (Human Anchor).**

**3. The implementation will strictly adhere to:**  
- Append-only audit logging and DCL integration  
- Constitutional safety and isolation mechanisms (§5)
- EU AI Act Article 14 compliance and full human oversight
- Role/permission enforcement per RACI matrix
- Public auditability and private operational security
- Professional CI/CD, documentation, and DevOps best practice

**4. Major technical decisions, deviations, or blockers must be logged as DCL entries.**

---

## Rationale

- **Transparency**: Ensures all technical development is visible, reviewable, and congruent with governance.
- **Safety**: Implements all constitutional and legal compliance requirements in practice.
- **Efficiency**: Centralizes all technical goals for Execution Node and supporting nodes to follow without ambiguity.
- **Accountability**: Assigns clear Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed roles for every engineering task.
- **Auditability**: All progress and key technical choices will be synchronously mirrored in DCL/system logs.

---

## Impact

- Phase 3 technical implementation process formally launched
- The aeonsync.nexus platform must now align with governance and constitutional core
- All technical activity tracked and documented from this decision forward
