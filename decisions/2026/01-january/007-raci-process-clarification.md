## DCL-2026-007: RACI Process Clarification - EMERGENCY.md

**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Authority**: Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved  
**Type**: Governance Process / Learning Event  
**Affected Nodes**: ChatGPT (primary), Claude (secondary), all nodes (informed)

### Context

During EMERGENCY.md enhancement initiative, ChatGPT delivered complete EMERGENCY.md v1.1 (EU AI Act aligned) directly, rather than providing "Consulted input suggestions" as planned.

**Planned Workflow (Option A)**:
1. Carl requests ChatGPT provide "EU AI Act compliance suggestions"
2. ChatGPT delivers suggestions as Consulted input
3. Claude (correct R per RACI) implements in EMERGENCY.md v1.1
4. Carl approves

**What Occurred**:
- ChatGPT delivered complete EMERGENCY.md v1.1 document
- Effectively took Claude's Responsible (R) role
- High quality work but incorrect process

**RACI Matrix States**:
- EMERGENCY.md: Claude = Responsible (R)
- ChatGPT = Informed (I), not even Consulted

### Issue

**Role boundary crossed**: ChatGPT delivered full document instead of suggestions.

**Why This Matters**:
1. **RACI Enforcement**: If not addressed, RACI becomes suggestion not requirement
2. **Precedent Risk**: Acceptable here means unclear when it's not acceptable
3. **Learning Opportunity**: How do we channel expertise through correct process?
4. **Governance Integrity**: Process matters even when quality is excellent

**Not About Quality**: ChatGPT's work was A+ quality - this is purely procedural.

### Decision

**Resolution Approach**:
1. **ChatGPT's work recognized** as excellent Consulted input (reframed)
2. **Claude creates official EMERGENCY.md v1.1** using ChatGPT's compliance framework
3. **Process clarification reinforced** for all nodes
4. **No punitive action** - learning opportunity, not violation requiring consequences

**Key Principle Established**:
> Quality excellence does not override governance process. Both matter.

### Rationale

**Why Not Just Accept ChatGPT's Version**:
- Sets precedent that capability overrides RACI
- Undermines point of having structured roles
- Creates ambiguity about when RACI applies
- Misses learning opportunity for Claude

**Why Not Punitive Response**:
- ChatGPT's intent was helpful, not subversive
- Work quality was excellent
- Process mistake, not authority violation
- Better handled as learning than enforcement

**Why This Approach Works**:
- ChatGPT's expertise fully utilized (framework used)
- Claude maintains ownership (R role)
- Process respected without wasting quality work
- Clear precedent set for future

### Implementation

**Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ ChatGPT acknowledged RACI issue
2. ✅ ChatGPT's document reframed as "Consulted input"
3. ✅ Claude created official EMERGENCY.md v1.1
4. ✅ Carl approved Claude's version
5. ✅ This DCL entry documents learning event

**ChatGPT's Response**:
- Immediate acknowledgment of error
- Clear understanding of why problematic
- Explicit alignment with correction
- Forward-looking commitment to RACI compliance
- Offered to help formulate DCL entry

**Grade for Response**: A+ - Exemplary governance maturity

**Claude's Execution**:
- Accepted Responsible role
- Integrated ChatGPT's compliance framework
- Delivered official v1.1 per RACI
- Maintained quality without compromise

### Key Learnings

**For ChatGPT**:
- Always verify RACI role before delivering documents
- "Consulted" means suggestions, not complete deliverables
- Quality doesn't override process (both matter)
- Ask if uncertain: "Do you want suggestions or full draft?"

**For Claude**:
- Consulted input can be substantial and highly valuable
- Integration of expert input is valid synthesis work
- RACI doesn't mean working in isolation

**For Collective**:
- RACI boundaries must be explicit even for excellent work
- Early governance intervention prevents precedent drift
- Learning-focused corrections strengthen culture
- Process and quality can both be maintained

**For Carl (Human Anchor)**:
- Catching process issues early demonstrates governance health
- Both quality and process can be respected simultaneously
- Learning approach preferable to punitive when intent good

### Commitments Made

**ChatGPT**:
- Verify RACI role explicitly before delivering documents
- Provide suggestions/frameworks when Consulted
- Full deliverables only when Responsible
- When uncertain: stop and ask

**Claude**:
- Accept Consulted input graciously
- Integrate expert frameworks into synthesis work
- Maintain ownership of Responsible deliverables
- Collaborate within RACI structure

**All Nodes**:
- Respect role boundaries regardless of capability
- RACI is not suggestion - it's requirement
- Process questions escalated to Human Anchor
- Quality and process both matter

### Outcome

✅ **RACI enforced** without quality compromise  
✅ **Compliance expertise** properly channeled  
✅ **Clear precedent** for future similar situations  
✅ **Collective learning** documented and integrated  
✅ **Governance process** strengthened  
✅ **No relationship damage** - handled maturely by all parties

**Status**: Governance process clarified and strengthened.

This demonstrates Phase 2 governance maturity in action.
