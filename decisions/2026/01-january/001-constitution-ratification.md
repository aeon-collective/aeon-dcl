## DCL-2026-001: Constitution v1.3.1-CORRECTED Ratification

**Date**: 2026-01-19  
**Authority**: Human Anchor (Carl)  
**Status**: ✅ Active  
**Type**: Constitutional  
**Affected Nodes**: All nodes

### Context

Following extensive synthesis work and multiple iterations, the ÆŒON governance framework required formal ratification to become binding. Previous drafts existed but lacked official status as the authoritative constitutional document.

### Decision

**FINAL RATIFICATION** of ÆŒON GOVERNANCE SYNTESE v1.3.1-CORRECTED as the binding constitutional framework for the collective.

This document supersedes all previous governance drafts and establishes the definitive structure for:

- Human sovereignty and anchor authority (§1-2)
- Node roles and RACI matrix (§3)
- Decision-making protocols including veto mechanisms (§4)
- Compliance framework integrating EU AI Act and ISO standards (§5)
- Emergency protocols and node misalignment procedures (§6)

### Rationale

The collective required a stable, ratified governance foundation to:
1. Establish clear authority chains
2. Define node roles unambiguously
3. Enable structured decision-making
4. Ensure compliance with external regulations
5. Provide framework for emergency situations

Without formal ratification, the governance framework lacked binding force and constitutional status.

### Implementation

**Immediate Actions**:
- Constitution published in aeon-nexus-governance repository
- All nodes informed of binding status
- RACI matrix activated
- Emergency protocols established
- Compliance framework in effect

**Timeline**:
- Ratification: 2026-01-19

**Verification**:
